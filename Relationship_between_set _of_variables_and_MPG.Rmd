### Executive Summary
The objective of the study was to look at a data set of a collection of cars and exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG). We were particularly interested in the following two questions:

* Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG ?
* Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions

While initial analysis shows that manual transmissions were better for MPG, but regression analysis shows that MPG mostily depends on weight and horsepower. Transmission was not major factor in determining MPG. 

### Exploratory Analysis
The data used for this analysis was obtained from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine. The data set contained 11 variables (including MPG) describing various aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models). See Table 1 in the Appendix for a description of each variable in the data set.
