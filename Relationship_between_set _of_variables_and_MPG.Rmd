### Executive Summary
The objective of the study was to look at a data set of a collection of cars and exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG). We were particularly interested in the following two questions:

* Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG ?
* Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions

While initial analysis shows that manual transmissions were better for MPG, but regression analysis shows that MPG mostily depends on weight and horsepower. Transmission was not major factor in determining MPG.
